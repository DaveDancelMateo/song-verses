First Verse

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry

If you go, I'm goin' too
'Cause it was always you
(Alright)
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby

Birds of a feather
We should stick together, I know
I said I'd never
Think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather
Might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but, baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

Second Verse

I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya

But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
Might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye

Third Verse

Birds of a feather
We should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
I said I'd never
Think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
Can't change the weather
Might not be forever ('til the day that I die)
But if it's forever it's even better

I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised
